/**
 * What the coach is told before it answers, and how far its answer is allowed

 *
 * The sentence this file exists to prevent is "the guide says use a PH0" when
 * the guide says nothing of the kind. A learner cannot tell the difference
 * between the expert's word and a model's guess once they have been blurred,
 * and they are holding a screwdriver over a live board while they decide.
 *
 * So the rule, here as everywhere else in this app: a claim may always be
