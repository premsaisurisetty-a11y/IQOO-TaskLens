/**
 * The one line of care a step may carry, and who is giving it.
 *
 * Two failures, and they pull in opposite directions. A warning nobody needed
 * spends the learner's attention on a risk that is not there and teaches them
 * the app invents things -- so an empty note must stay empty rather than
 * becoming a polite sentence. And a warning the model thought of but attributed
 * to the expert puts a safety claim in a real person's mouth, which is worse
 * than either.
 *
 * Nothing here can stop a learner or an expert doing anything. A warning is
 * advice; the Player draws it and the Review screen shows it, and neither
 * consults it before enabling a control.
