/**
 * The layer between a 2B model's habits and the guide a stranger reads.
 *
 * This is the only part of the coach testable without a phone, and it is the
 * part that decides what a real person is recorded as having said. Every input
 * below is a shape a small model actually produced.
 *
 * The format is `number|SOURCE|title|instruction|note` and not JSON on purpose:
 * tasks-genai 0.10.35 has no constrained decoding, so the shape is a request
 * rather than a guarantee, and JSON fails as one piece -- one unbalanced brace
 * costs every step including the eight that were right. Lines fail one at a
 * time.
