/**

 * whole session and may catch it anyway. It is claiming one that never
 * happened, because the guide then drops the instruction the expert actually
 * meant, and the learner never learns it was there.
 *
 * So most of these assert null. "No" is a word people say constantly without
 * retracting anything, and every test below that ends in null is a sentence
 * a keyword matcher would have got wrong.
