/**
 * Does the bench look like the step, decided without waking a model.
 *
 * The rule the whole file is built around: there is no fourth value. Nothing
 * here can say BLOCKED, because nothing in this app disables Next, hides
 * Continue or refuses to advance on a camera's opinion. A learner holding the
 * board at a different angle is not wrong, and an app that stops them there is
 * worse than an app that says nothing.
 *
 * The second rule, and the reason this file was rewritten: a verdict is made
 * out of frames, plural. One frame is evidence, never an answer.
