/**
 * The shipped policy.json has to carry every knob [Policy] has.
 *
 * This exists because it already failed once, silently, in the worst possible
 * way. `Policy.kt` was fixed to hold the Devanagari linking words the Vosk
 * models actually emit; the asset still held only the romanised ones. On first
 * run the asset is copied to filesDir and from then on the app reads *only*
 * that file -- so the fix was live in the source, dead on every phone, and the
 * config file looked entirely correct while the confirmer abstained on every
 * cut. Nothing crashed and nothing logged.
 *
 * A missing key is not a crash either, because the parser is deliberately
 * lenient and fills in the Kotlin default. That is the trap: during the ten
 * hours nobody can compile, a knob that is not in this file is a knob the team
 * cannot turn, and there is no symptom until someone needs it at 3am.
 *
 * Keys, not values. The team is meant to tune the asset away from the defaults
 * -- that is what it is for. Drifting out of sync is the thing to catch.
