/**
 * The laptop-repair session Task Lens is judged on, written down.
 *
 * Fixtures rather than recordings, because a recording needs a phone, a room
 * and a person, and the point of these is that they run on every machine, in
 * every build, in under a second, and give the same answer every time.
 *
 * **What this harness evaluates is Task Lens, not Gemma.** No model file is
 * needed or wanted here: the coach's replies are canned, chosen to be the
 * shapes a small model actually produces -- including the wrong ones -- and
 * every assertion is about what this app does when handed them. Whether Gemma
 * writes a good instruction is a question for a phone with 2 GB free; whether
 * this app attributes an invented instruction to a real person is a question
 * for a JVM, and it is the more dangerous of the two.
