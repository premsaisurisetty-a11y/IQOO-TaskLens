/**
 * Whether a step has a picture of what it should end up looking like.
 *
 * The Player itself needs an emulator to test, but this decision does not, and
 * it is the one that matters: it is what stands between a learner and a black
 * rectangle captioned "no photo" taking a third of their screen to announce a
 * failure that has not happened. A step without a photo is ordinary -- the
 * phone was face down, or the nearest frame was the inside of a pocket -- and
 * the honest answer is the instruction and the expert's voice, with no picture.
