/**
 * Transcription by the phone's own speech engine, which is the only route to
 * hardware-accelerated speech on this device.
 *
 * Vosk is Kaldi: a C++ decoder with no delegate and no accelerator, so it will
 * always be CPU no matter what model is fed to it. The system recogniser is the
 * opposite -- Qualcomm and the OEM run it on the Hexagon DSP, and it is the
 * same engine the phone uses for its own dictation, so it is far better on
 * English than a 600 MB Kaldi graph.
 *
 * [SpeechRecognizer.createOnDeviceSpeechRecognizer] is used deliberately rather
 * than the ordinary one. The ordinary recogniser is allowed to use the network;
 * the on-device recogniser is contractually not. That distinction is the
 * difference between this app keeping its central claim and quietly breaking
 * it, and it is why the ordinary constructor appears nowhere in this file.
 *
 * **It has no word timings.** The system engine returns sentences, not word
 * clocks. Rather than invent timings -- which would poison the step cutter with
 * confident nonsense -- [hasWordTimings] is false and the ViewModel transcribes
 * each step's slice separately once the cuts are already decided. The
 * link-word confirmer then abstains, which is the behaviour it was written to
 * have when there is nothing to vote with.
