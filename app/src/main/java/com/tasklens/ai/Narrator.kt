/**
 * Reads a step aloud in a synthetic voice.
 *
 * The expert's own recording is still on disk and still the source of truth --
 * this is a second way to hear a step, for the case where the expert mumbled,
 * spoke over a drill, or said it in a language the person following does not
 * read. A synthetic voice is only better than a real one when the real one is
 * hard to follow, so nothing here deletes take.wav.
 *
 * **Offline voices only.** Android ships voices that synthesise on the phone
 * and voices that call home, and the API will happily pick a network one if it
 * sounds better. [offlineVoice] rejects those outright: a guide that needs a
 * signal to read a step aloud is not the product this app claims to be.
