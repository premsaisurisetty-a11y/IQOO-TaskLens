 * opens that guide cold and needs an ordered instruction they can follow with
 * their hands full, plus somewhere to put the question the expert never thought
 * to answer, like which screwdriver.
 *
 * So the coach runs twice, over the same guide, with the same model:
 *
 *   [rewrite] once, when the guide is built -- the expert's transcript becomes
 *             a clean numbered instruction. The original transcript is kept,
 *             never overwritten, because it is the evidence.
 *   [answer]  live, in the Player -- a question against the whole guide.
 *
 * **It answers in English on purpose.** The take is Hindi or Marathi and Gemma
 * at this size is markedly weaker in both; a fluent English answer is more use
 * to a learner than broken Marathi, and the expert's own audio is still there
 * for anyone who wants the original words.
 *
 * **It is allowed to know things the guide does not.** That is the whole point
 * of [answer] -- "which screwdriver" is a question no transcript contains. It
 * is also the one place in this app where a model may say something the expert
 * did not, so [BEYOND] makes it mark those sentences and the Player labels
 * them. A model that quietly blends the two would put words in the expert's
 * mouth, which is the failure this codebase has spent every other model
 * avoiding.
 *
 * Same shape as every other model here: gitignored file under `filesDir`, a
 * delegate ladder, one load, and an empty answer when the model is absent --
 * never a canned one.
 *
 * ponytail: one-shot [LlmInference.generateResponse] per call, no session and
 * no history, so a follow-up question does not know about the previous one.
 * LlmInferenceSession is the upgrade if the demo needs a conversation.

            You are turning one expert's recorded repair session into a written
            guide for someone doing the job for the first time.

            The job: $job

            Below is the whole session in order. For each step you get its time,
            what the expert said (transcribed, informal, possibly Hindi or
            Marathi, possibly garbled), and what an object detector reported
            seeing in that step's photograph. You cannot see the photographs
            yourself; the detector's labels are all the visual evidence there is.

            $body

            Read all of it before writing anything. Then write the guide.

            Start with one line naming the job, in this exact form:

            TITLE|a short name for this job

            Four or five words, naming the thing worked on and what was done
            to it, taken only from what the expert actually said in the session
            above. Do not reuse any wording from these instructions.

            If most steps have nothing said in them, or the transcript is too
            garbled to tell what the job was, write exactly TITLE|Untitled job.
            An honestly unnamed guide is better than a confident wrong name: the
            expert renames it on the next screen either way.

            Rules:
            - Keep the steps in the order they happened, and keep their numbers.
            - If the expert corrected themselves later, follow the correction
              and do not repeat what they took back.
            - Where a step is marked "possible self-correction", that is
              something noticed in the wording and the timing, not a
              conclusion. Judge it against the rest of the session: if they did
              change their mind, write only what they settled on; if they did
              not -- "no problem" is not a correction -- ignore the note and
              write the step as spoken.
            - If a step is an aside, a false start, or an instruction the expert
              abandoned, mark it SKIP instead of rewriting it.
            - Never state a fact the session does not support. If you are unsure
              what happened in a step, say so in the note rather than guessing.
            - Do not invent tools, part names, torque figures or measurements
              that were neither spoken nor detected.

            Answer with one line per step and nothing else, in exactly this
            format:

            number|SOURCE|short title|one or two sentence instruction|WHO: note

            SOURCE says where your instruction came from:
              EXPERT   you rewrote what the expert said in this step
              VISUAL   the expert said nothing useful; you used the detector
              GENERAL  neither -- this is your own repair knowledge
              SKIP     this step does not belong in the guide
            The note is one short line of care for this step, or empty. Start
            it with where it comes from, the same four words: "EXPERT: " if the
            expert actually said it, "VISUAL: " if it follows from what the
            detector saw, "GENERAL: " if it is your own repair knowledge.

            Leave the note empty unless there is a real reason for it. Most
            steps have none, an empty note is the right answer, and a caution
            nobody needed costs the learner their attention on the one that
            matters. Never invent a risk to fill the column.

            Keep it to the kind of thing anyone doing this job would want said
            out loud -- "Keep track of the removed screws." or "Be careful not
            to pull the connector by the wires." Do not give torque figures,
            voltages, part numbers or specific safety procedures unless the
            expert said them: you do not know this machine, and a confident
            number nobody checked is worse than silence.
