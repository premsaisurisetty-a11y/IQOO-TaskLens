 * EfficientDet-Lite running on this phone, with the score it actually returned.
 * Drawing the same three labels every time would have been half a day cheaper
 * and would have been a lie.
 *
 * **Two models run per frame, not one.** Fine-tuning for the tools threw away
 * the eighty classes COCO had, and a bench with no laptop on it is not much of
 * a laptop repair guide. So the stock COCO detector runs beside the fine-tuned
 * one and the two sets of boxes are concatenated -- a philips head on a laptop
 * lid is two true boxes, not a contradiction, and nothing here has to choose
 * between them.
 *
 * Each model is held to its own labels ([DetectorModel.labels]) and its own
 * floor, which is what keeps the seam clean: the fine-tuned model answers for
 * the screwdriver and the screw heads, COCO answers for the room, and neither
 * is asked about the other's subject.
 *
 * A model missing from the phone is skipped with a line in logcat and the other
 * carries on -- push only COCO and the tools go quiet, push only the tools and
 * the laptop does. Both missing is an empty list, and the overlay draws nothing.
 *
 * Same shape as [MediaPipeGestureSource] on purpose: same delegate ladder, same
 * fire-and-forget failure.
 *
 * ponytail: two models is two inferences per frame, ~36 ms of NPU rather than
 * 18. That fits the analyzer's interval; if it stops fitting, drop COCO to
 * every other frame before doing anything cleverer. Boxes also do not track
 * between frames, so a borderline score can flicker -- raise the floor first, a
 * per-label DwellLatch is the upgrade if that is not enough.
