/**
 * How much the guide and the camera actually support an answer.
 *
 * The learner asks "is this the right screwdriver?" and there are four honest
 * replies, which differ in who is vouching for them rather than in how
 * confident they sound:
 *
 *   DIRECT_GUIDE_FACT  the guide says so. The expert did this job and wrote it.
 *   VISUAL_FACT        the detector reported it, in this frame or this step's
 *                      photograph. A real observation by a model that looked.
 *   GENERAL_KNOWLEDGE  neither. Laptops usually take a Phillips; nobody checked
 *                      this laptop.
 *   UNCERTAIN          nothing here identifies the thing being asked about.
 *
 * The one that costs a learner a broken laptop is general knowledge wearing the
 * guide's authority, which is why [groundedEvidence] exists and why nothing may
 * ever be promoted into DIRECT_GUIDE_FACT.
 *
 * UNCERTAIN is an answer, not a refusal. It says what is missing and lets the
 * learner decide; it never stops them, hides a control, or declines to reply.
