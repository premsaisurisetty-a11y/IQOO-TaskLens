/**
 * Real on-device transcription from a Vosk model, one language at a time.
 *
 * **A Vosk model speaks exactly one language and cannot be talked out of it.**
 * It is a Kaldi acoustic model plus a fixed lexicon, so a Hindi model handed
 * English audio does not fail and does not return nothing -- it returns the
 * nearest Hindi words it owns. That is why "hello, my name is Kshitij Desai,
 * today test model rendering" came back as Devanagari nonsense: the model was
 * working correctly on input it was never given a way to represent.
 *
 * So language is a property of the take, chosen before recording, and each
 * language gets its own directory:
 *
 *     filesDir/models/vosk-en/   vosk-hi/   vosk-mr/
 *
 * Only one is held in memory at a time, because a Kaldi graph is hundreds of
 * megabytes and three of them is most of a phone's spare RAM. Switching costs
 * a load, which is why it happens when a person picks a language rather than
 * per utterance.
 *
 * Everything is written around the models being absent, because they are
 * gitignored and a fresh install has none: no model means an empty word list,
 * never canned data. A demo that quietly falls back to a fake is a demo that
 * lies to the jury.
 *
 * Lifecycle is the ladder every model in this app uses:
 * LOAD -> VERIFY -> INIT -> INFER -> RELEASE. Vosk is Kaldi, so it is CPU
 * only; there is no NNAPI or GPU rung to fall down.
