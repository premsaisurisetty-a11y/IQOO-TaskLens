 * Describes a step's photo by naming what is actually in it.

 * This replaces the last canned answer in the app. FakeCaptioner cycled four
 * sentences about a coffee filter, which read fine in a mockup and read as a
 * lie the first time someone recorded a laptop repair -- the guide came back
 * saying "hand on the lid, turning it anticlockwise" over a picture of a
 * keyboard.
 *
 * So the caption is a list of the things the detector found, in the order it
 * was most sure about them. It is a plain description rather than a sentence,
 * which is the honest shape for what a box-and-label model actually knows.
 *
 * No model, no caption. An empty string is correct: the transcript already
 * carries what the step is, and every screen falls back to it.
