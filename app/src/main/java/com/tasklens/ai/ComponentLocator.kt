 * asked more politely. Every one of those requests comes back [Uncertain] with
 * that said in words, and no box is drawn.
 *
 * The swap is a file and a config edit, no rebuild:
 *
 *   1. push a fine-tuned `.tflite` over `filesDir/models/object_detector.tflite`
 *   2. add its labels to `componentAliases` in policy.json
 *
 * The aliases are what make it swappable rather than hardcoded. MediaPipe's
 * ObjectDetector cannot be asked what vocabulary a model has before running it,
 * so the app cannot discover the answer -- it has to be told, and policy.json is
 * where this project tells it things during the hours nobody can compile. An
 * empty alias list for a component is the honest state today and reads as "this
 * detector has no label for that", which is exactly true.
