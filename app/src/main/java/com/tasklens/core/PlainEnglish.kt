/**
 * Turning what a person said into something a stranger can read.
 *
 * A recogniser returns a flat lowercase stream: no capitals, no full stops, and
 * every "um" the expert said on their way to the point. That is the correct
 * output for a recogniser and the wrong thing to put in front of a learner --
 * a step that reads "um so uh you take the screwdriver and um turn it" is
 * harder to follow than the audio it came from.
 *
 * Two facts about spoken English are enough to fix most of it, and both are
 * free because the recogniser already reports word clocks:
 *
 *   - **A hesitation is not a word.** "um", "uh", "erm" carry no meaning; they
 *     are the sound of someone thinking. So is an immediately repeated word --
 *     "the the screwdriver" is one restart, not two articles.
 *   - **A pause is punctuation.** The gap a speaker leaves between finishing
 *     one thought and starting the next is exactly where a full stop belongs.
 *     Nothing has to guess at sentence structure; the expert already performed
 *     it, and the clocks recorded it.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here is any attempt at grammar. No comma
 * insertion, no clause detection, no rewriting. Those need a language model and
 * would be the app putting words in the expert's mouth, which is [Coach]'s job
 * and is labelled as such wherever it happens.
 */

/**
 * Drop hesitations and restarts, keeping every clock intact.
 *
 * [fillers] comes from policy.json and holds *only* sounds that are never
 * content. It does not ship with "like", "so", "actually", "right" or
 * "basically", and that omission is the point: every one of those is a real
 * word in a real instruction -- "turn it like this", "so it sits flat", "right
 * up against the frame". Stripping them would delete meaning from a guide and
 * nobody would be able to tell from the result. They can be added in
 * policy.json by someone who has listened to the take and decided.
