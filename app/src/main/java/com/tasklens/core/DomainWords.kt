/**
 * Repair the handful of words this job depends on and a general recogniser
 * mangles.
 *
 * **This is not the recogniser learning anything.** Vosk decodes against a
 * fixed Kaldi graph; the vocabulary is `graph/words.txt` and nothing at runtime
 * adds to it. Checked against the shipped English model, every term here is
 * already in that 368k-word vocabulary -- so the model *can* say "screwdriver",
 * it just often prefers the likelier "screw driver", because a general language
 * model has read far more sentences about drivers than about screwdrivers.
 *
 * So the fix is at the other end: take the words it did return and put the
 * domain ones back together. Two rules, both deliberately timid, because a
 * corrector that guesses is worse than a recogniser that mishears -- a wrong
 * word the expert never said is exactly the confident nonsense this app
 * refuses everywhere else.
 *
 *   1. **Join.** Two adjacent tokens that spell a term when run together become
 *      that term: "screw driver", "counter clockwise", "anti clockwise".
 *   2. **Near miss.** A single token one edit away from a term of eight
 *      characters or more becomes that term: "screwdrive", "clockwize".
 *
 * The eight-character floor is the whole safety margin. Short words are where
 * an edit of one turns a real word into a different real word -- "flip" and
 * "clip", "hex" and "her" -- and no floor on length would have the corrector
 * quietly rewriting speech that was heard correctly. Long technical words have
 * no such neighbours.
 *
 * A token that already spells a term exactly is never touched.
 *
 * ponytail: Levenshtein over a short list, per token, per transcript. A trie
 * would be faster and is worth it at a few hundred terms, not at fifteen.
