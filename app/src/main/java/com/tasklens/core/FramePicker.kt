 * @param dHash structure, from [SceneHash.dHash]. Used only to reject a frame
 *   that repeats the previous step's, never to judge one on its own.

 *   something recognisable is in shot, and nothing more -- what those things

 * This is the answer to the detector's biggest limitation, and it costs no
 * model at all. The detector knows six tools and six pieces of furniture; an
 * expert's bench has forty things on it, and the moment that matters -- holding
 * one up to the lens and saying what it is -- produces no box, so the frame
 * picker scored it the same as a frame of an empty table.
 *
 * But the expert *said the word*. A person naming a thing while showing it is
 * better evidence of what is being demonstrated than any classifier on this
 * phone, it needs no training data, and it works for a part no dataset covers.
 * So the words become a third kind of evidence beside sharpness and lateness.
 *
 * Counted, not merely flagged, because "the philips screwdriver" names two
 * terms and is more certainly the moment than a passing "screw".
 *
 * ponytail: exact token match, which is why the domain corrector runs first --
 * "screw driver" has already become "screwdriver" by the time this sees it.
 * Stemming is the upgrade if plurals start slipping through.

/**
 * One photograph per step, or none.
 *
 * The step cutter finds boundaries from sound alone and must stay that way --
 * pure arithmetic over a level log, no model, provably correct off a phone.
 * This runs afterwards, over frames that already exist, and decides which of
 * them is worth showing. It changes no boundary and calls nothing that could.
 *
 * [mapSnapsToSteps] answers "which step does this photo belong to" by time, and
 * is still the answer when nothing has been measured. This answers a different
 * question -- "of the photos that belong to this step, which one is worth
 * looking at" -- and it is allowed to answer "none of them". A step with no
 * usable frame shows its instruction and the expert's voice, which is a
 * complete step; a blurred smear captioned "aiming for" is worse than nothing,
 * because the learner will try to match it.
 *
 * Frames are rejected outright for being unusable, then the survivors are
 * scored and the best one wins:
 *
 *   blurry     below [Policy.frameMinSharpness] -- a phone still in motion
 *   empty      outside the luma band -- a lens on a bench, a pocket, a worklight
 *   duplicate  too close to the frame the previous step already took
 *
 * The score prefers a sharp frame, one the detector found something in, and one
 * late in the step. Late matters most and is the reason this exists: a step's
 * photograph is meant to show what it looks like when it is *done*, and the
 * frame nearest the start of a step is a picture of the work not yet begun.
 *
 * Deterministic throughout. Same frames in, same choice out, every time -- ties
 * fall to the later frame, then the higher snap index, so there is no run where
 * two equally good frames swap places.
