/**
 * Reason to think the expert took something back and said it again.
 *
 * **Evidence, never a verdict.** Nothing here rewrites an instruction, drops a
 * step or overrules a word of the transcript. It notices that a step looks like
 * a self-repair, says which signals it noticed, and hands that to the coach as
 * one more thing to read. The coach decides -- it is the only part of this app
 * that has read the whole session and can tell "no, not that one" from "no
 * problem".
 *
 * That division is the whole design. Deciding from the wording alone would be a
 * keyword matcher rewriting a real person's instructions, and "no" is a word
 * people say constantly without retracting anything.
 *
 * @param retractionAtMs when the retraction was spoken, on the take's clock.
 * @param strength 0..1, how much evidence there is. Never a probability, just
 *   an ordering, so the coach can weigh a strong signal above a faint one.
 * @param signals what was actually noticed, in words. Goes into the prompt and
 *   the debug screen, because "strength 0.7" tells nobody anything.
 * @param supersededText what was said before the retraction, kept verbatim.
 * @param correctedText what was said after it, kept verbatim.

/**
 * Look for a self-correction inside one step.
 *
 * "Remove this screw... no, sorry, not this one. Remove the side screw." is one
 * step to the cutter -- it is one run of speech with no long pause in it -- and
 * two contradictory instructions to a learner. Left alone, the coach reads both
 * halves as equally meant and writes the guide accordingly.
 *
 * Four signals, and **a retraction word is never enough on its own**:
 *
 *   marker      "no", "sorry", "nahi", "galat", "wait". Necessary, never
 *               sufficient. People say "no problem" and "no, that's fine" all
 *               day without taking anything back.
 *   repeat      a content word said on both sides of the marker -- "screw"
 *               before and "screw" after. This is what separates a repair from
 *               a change of subject: a repair says the same thing again.
 *   hesitation  "uh", "matlab", "actually" near the marker. People stumble
 *               when they are correcting themselves.
 *   proximity   the marker landed within [Policy.correctionWindowMs] of the
 *               words it retracts. A repair is immediate; a minute later is a
 *               new thought.
 *
 * And one signal *against*, which is where [LinkWordConfirmer]'s word list
 * earns a second use: a linking word after the marker -- "phir", "then", "uske
 * baad" -- argues the expert moved on to the next thing rather than repaired
 * the last one. The same list that says "a new step starts here" says "this was
 * not a correction".
 *
 * Returns null when the evidence does not clear [Policy.correctionMinStrength],
 * and null is the ordinary answer: most steps contain no correction, and a
 * false positive costs a learner the instruction that was actually meant.
 *
 * Timestamps are used when there are any. A recogniser that returns sentences
 * rather than word clocks gives every word the same time; proximity then simply
 * abstains rather than firing on everything, in the same spirit as the
 * confirmer abstaining when it has nothing to vote with.
