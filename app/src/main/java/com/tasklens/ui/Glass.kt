 *
 *   [aurora]  the room the app sits in: a deep violet field with two soft light
 *             sources and a pair of window streaks across it. Painted once,
 *             behind every screen.
 *   [glass]   a pane floating in that room: a translucent fill, a specular
 *             hairline that is bright where light lands and dim where it does
 *             not, and a shadow underneath.
 *   [grain]   the thing that stops all of it looking like a gradient from 2014.
 *             Film grain, tiled, at a few percent.
 *
 * The grain matters more than it sounds. A flat gradient on an OLED phone bands
 * into visible steps; noise at 4% dithers those steps away and reads as texture
 * rather than as a defect.
