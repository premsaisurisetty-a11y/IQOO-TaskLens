/**
 * One dark palette, because every screen in this product is looked at over a
 * workbench, a stove or an open laptop -- places with a bright thing in the
 * middle of the frame. A paper-white app next to a viewfinder is two different
 * exposures fighting each other.
 *
 * The field is violet rather than neutral black: the app is made of glass
 * ([Modifier.glass]), and glass over pure grey has nothing to be translucent
 * *of*. The panes pick up the field behind them, which is the whole effect.
 *
 * Colour carries meaning here and is not decoration:
 *
 *   [Ink.blue]   an action the user takes
 *   [Ink.teal]   the same action while the phone is being talked to, not touched
 *   [Ink.green]  something the phone actually measured -- a detection, a step
 *                that really happened, a stage that really finished
 *   [Ink.amber]  the phone is listening
 *   [Ink.red]    recording
 *
 * Nothing is ever greyed out to mean "you may not". Grey means "not now",
 * never "not allowed" -- there is no disabled control in this app.
