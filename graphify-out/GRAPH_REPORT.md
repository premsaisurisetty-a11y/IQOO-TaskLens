## Ambiguous Edges - Review These
- `Warnings Advise, They Never Block` → `TaskLensViewModel`  [AMBIGUOUS]
  AGENTS.md · relation: conceptually_related_to
- `mergeShort and maxSteps Cap` → `Demo Runbook and Five Recorded Guides`  [AMBIGUOUS]
  docs/WORKFLOW.md · relation: conceptually_related_to
- `Policy Hot-Reload` → `Conflict Escape Hatch`  [AMBIGUOUS]
  docs/WORKFLOW.md · relation: semantically_similar_to

## Knowledge Gaps
- **30 isolated node(s):** `NONE`, `OPEN_PALM`, `FIST`, `THUMB_UP`, `POINT` (+25 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components.
- **1 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **What is the exact relationship between `Warnings Advise, They Never Block` and `TaskLensViewModel`?**
  _Edge tagged AMBIGUOUS (relation: conceptually_related_to) - confidence is low._
- **What is the exact relationship between `mergeShort and maxSteps Cap` and `Demo Runbook and Five Recorded Guides`?**
  _Edge tagged AMBIGUOUS (relation: conceptually_related_to) - confidence is low._
- **What is the exact relationship between `Policy Hot-Reload` and `Conflict Escape Hatch`?**
  _Edge tagged AMBIGUOUS (relation: semantically_similar_to) - confidence is low._
- **Why does `Core Systems Role` connect `Core Laws And Verification` to `Guide Storage And Navigation`, `Compose Screens And UI Rules`, `Policy Store And Reload Tests`, `Step Cutter And Its Tests`, `Adaptive Gate And Motion Source`, `Mode Engine And Its Tests`, `Audio Recorder And Model Integration`, `Scene Hash Image Similarity`, `Demo, Pitch And Policy Tuning Roles`, `CameraX Capture Controller`, `Policy Tunable Numbers`, `Offline Proof And Demo Runbook`, `Policy Hot Reload Watcher`, `Build Verify And Red Light`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.273) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `TaskLensViewModel` connect `Guide Storage And Navigation` to `Scene Check And Architecture Rationale`, `AI Interfaces And Fakes`, `Compose Screens And UI Rules`, `Policy Store And Reload Tests`, `Audio Recorder And Model Integration`, `CameraX Capture Controller`, `Core Laws And Verification`, `Policy Tunable Numbers`, `Offline Proof And Demo Runbook`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.267) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `SceneHash` connect `Scene Hash Image Similarity` to `Scene Check And Architecture Rationale`, `Compose Screens And UI Rules`, `Core Laws And Verification`, `Adaptive Gate And Motion Source`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.098) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 4 inferred relationships involving `Core Systems Role` (e.g. with `AudioRecorder` and `CameraController`) actually correct?**
  _`Core Systems Role` has 4 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
