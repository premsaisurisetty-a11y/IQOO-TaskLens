# AGENTS.md — Task Lens

Read this before touching anything. It is the entry point for **any** coding
agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Aider, Continue, Zed) or human.
Tool-specific files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) only point
back here.

## 1. What Task Lens is

An offline Android app. An expert does a job once and narrates it in Hindi or
English. The phone turns that single take into a step-by-step guide — one photo
and one audio slice per step. Anyone else then runs the guide hands-free.
Everything runs on the device; nothing leaves the phone.

Marathi is not offered for recording: Vosk ships no Marathi model, and a button
that records a take and returns nothing is the failure this app refuses. The
Marathi linking words, voice and labels are all still there for guides already
recorded in it. See `VoskAsr.LANGUAGES`.

Built for **iQOO City Battles 2026** (30-hour hackathon, three-person team).

## 2. The four hard constraints

These are product claims made to a jury. Breaking one is worse than shipping
less. Never "temporarily" relax one.

1. **No `INTERNET` permission.** The manifest declares only `CAMERA` and
   `RECORD_AUDIO`, and strips `INTERNET`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` and
   `WAKE_LOCK` with `tools:node="remove"` in case a dependency merges them in.
   The demo proves this in the Android app-info screen in four seconds.
2. **The step cutter is a pause detector plus a word list.** No video model, no
   ML anywhere in that path. It must run on a five-year-old phone.
3. **The mode engine contains no AI.** Plain rules over four booleans, decides
   in well under 10 ms.
4. **Warnings advise, they never block.** There is no disabled button anywhere
   in the app. Anything the phone cannot honestly measure (gloves, driving,
   age, whether the work is correct) is a *setting*, never a guess.

## 3. Invariants an agent must not break

| Invariant | How to check it |
|---|---|
| No network permission survives the merge | `grep -o 'android.permission[^"]*' app/build/intermediates/merged_manifest/*/*/AndroidManifest.xml \| sort -u` |
| `core/` is pure Kotlin, zero `android.*` | `grep -rn '^import android' app/src/main/java/com/tasklens/core/` must print nothing |
| Every tunable number lives in `Policy` | new knobs go in `core/Policy.kt` **and** `app/src/main/assets/policy.json` |
| A malformed `policy.json` never crashes and never resets tuning | `PolicyStoreTest` |
| Step ranges tile the take exactly — no gaps, no overlaps | `StepCutterTest` |
| Core logic stays JVM-testable in seconds | `./gradlew test` |

## 4. Stack and commands

Kotlin 2.4.10 · AGP 9.4.0 · Compose (BOM 2026.08.00, Material 3) · CameraX
1.6.2 · media3 1.11.0 · kotlinx-serialization + coroutines. `minSdk 30`,
`targetSdk 36`, `compileSdk 37`, `arm64-v8a` only. Needs **JDK 17+**.

```bash
./gradlew test            # core logic, JVM, seconds — run this constantly
./gradlew assembleDebug   # APK
./gradlew build           # both variants + lint (slow)
```

`local.properties` is gitignored; Android Studio writes it, or create it with
`sdk.dir=<path to your Android SDK>`.

**Retune the running app without compiling** (the whole point of `policy.json`,
see §7):

```bash
adb push policy.json /data/local/tmp/
adb shell run-as com.tasklens cp /data/local/tmp/policy.json files/policy.json
```

## 5. Layout and file ownership

Git conflicts happen when two people edit the same file. The team's rule is
that no two people ever edit the same file. **An agent inherits the ownership
of whoever is driving it.** If a change belongs in someone else's folder, stop
and say so instead of making it.

| Path | Owner | What lives there |
|---|---|---|
| `app/src/main/java/com/tasklens/core/` | Kshitij | Gate, step cutter, mode engine, policy. Zero `android.*` imports. |
| `app/src/main/java/com/tasklens/capture/` | Kshitij | AudioRecorder, CameraController, MotionSource |
| `app/src/main/java/com/tasklens/ai/` | Kshitij | Asr, Captioner, GestureSource, SceneCheck + fakes |
| `app/src/main/java/com/tasklens/data/` | Kshitij | Guide, Step, GuideStore, PolicyRepository |
| `app/src/main/java/com/tasklens/ui/` | Anushka | Every Compose screen, theme, all visuals |
| `app/src/main/assets/policy.json` | Ayaan | Every tunable number, both word lists |
| `docs/`, `README.md` | Ayaan (except `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, Kshitij) | Docs, pitch, demo notes, Office Kit log |
| `app/build.gradle.kts`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, `gradle/libs.versions.toml` | **Kshitij only** | Nobody else touches these, ever |

### Which teammate am I working as?

An agent cannot guess this, and guessing wrong means editing someone else's
file. Read it from git — the same identity that will author the commit:

```bash
git config user.name     # Kshitij Desai | Anushka Unde | Ayaan Memon
```

Match that name against the table above and stay inside those paths. **If it
comes back empty, or does not match a row, stop and ask who you are working as
before writing anything.** An empty `user.name` also means commits land as
`unknown`, which makes the ownership rule unenforceable after the fact.

Each person sets it once, on their own machine:

```bash
git config --global user.name  "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

`git log --format='%an %ae' -5` shows who has actually been committing, which
is the fastest way to check the rule is holding.

## 6. Current state — what is real and what is left

Do not assume a class does what its name suggests. Verified against the code,
not remembered.

**Real and tested** (54 JVM tests, all passing)

- `core/AdaptiveGate` — tracks the room's noise floor so a fixed dB threshold
  cannot fail in a fan-noise kitchen. Eats `-Infinity`/NaN from a dead mic.
- `core/StepCutter` — silence runs ≥ `pauseMs` become cuts at the pause
  midpoint; short utterances merge forward; hard cap at `maxSteps`.
- `core/LinkWordConfirmer` — real, and passed to `StepCutter` by the ViewModel.
  Abstains when there is nothing to vote with, because "no opinion" has to mean
  pass-through or the app hands back one enormous step.
- `core/mapSnapsToSteps` — photos are paired to final steps **by time**, each
  photo offered to its best step. This is the fix for the old photo-indexing
  defect; `SnapMapperTest` is what keeps it fixed.
- `core/ModeEngine` — EASY/HANDS/TALK/TAP from four booleans, Schmitt triggers
  plus a dwell timer so nothing flickers. Drives `PlayerScreen`, not just Debug.
- `core/SceneHash`, `core/DwellLatch`, `core/Policy`, `core/PolicyStore`,
  `data/PolicyRepository` — live reload, and `PolicyAssetTest` fails the build
  if `policy.json` drifts out of sync with `Policy.kt`.
- `capture/` — all three sources work. `data/GuideStore` — plain folders.
- `ui/` — five screens wired end to end; the Player binds the camera and reads
  gestures, mode, detections and scene similarity.

**Real models, no fakes anywhere.** `Fakes.kt` is gone. Every model here is a
gitignored file under `filesDir/models/`, loads down a delegate ladder, and
returns *nothing* when it is absent — never canned data.

- `ai/DeviceAsr` → `ai/VoskAsr` — the system on-device recogniser, Vosk as
  fallback. One Vosk model per language; language is picked before recording.
- `ai/ObjectDetectSource` + `ai/DetectorCaptioner` — real boxes, real scores,
  and captions that are the labels the detector actually returned.
- `ai/MediaPipeGestureSource`, `ai/RealSceneCheck`, `ai/DeviceNarrator`.
- `ai/Coach` — the on-device Gemma that rewrites the expert's steps into an
  English instruction and answers the learner's questions. See
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §11 for the model files and how to install them.

**What is actually left**

- **The coach has never answered a real question.** A `models/coach.task` is on
  the demo phone, but the first two bundles put there never opened. Both wrapped
  the legacy Kaggle Gemma 2B `.bin` under the `TF_LITE_PREFILL_DECODE` key, and
  that model is a single `GEMMA_2B` subgraph with **no signature defs at all**,
  while tasks-genai 0.10.35 wants a bundle whose model exposes `prefill_*` and
  `decode` signatures. Both backends failed the same way: `decode_runner !=
  nullptr` on the OpenCL executor, `Decode runner not found for provided
  signature name base: decode` on XNNPACK. Repackaging cannot fix that, because
  a zip cannot add a signature to the model inside it. What is installed now is
  the LiteRT-community `gemma3-1b-it-int4.task` (555 MB), whose model carries
  five signatures -- `decode` and `prefill_32/128/512/1024` -- with 55 inputs
  apiece. Confirm it with the Debug screen before trusting anything else here.
  Load time, inference time and memory use are still unmeasured, and that is
  still the single largest unknown in the project.
- `userFar` is always false, and the code now says so instead of pretending
  otherwise. It used to be fed by a branch that looked for a `person` box, which
  could never arrive: neither detector's allowlist contains `person`, by design,
  and `ObjectDetectSource` enforces that in the graph and again on the way out.
  So `feedFaceSize` is called with 0 and the `ModeEngine` branch stays
  unreachable. It needs a face detector, and §2's fourth constraint says we do
  not guess at what we cannot honestly measure.
- The object detector is generic COCO -- "laptop", "keyboard", "person". It has
  no label for a screw, a RAM module, an SSD or a screwdriver and never will
  until a different `.tflite` is on the phone. Nothing in the app claims
  otherwise; `AnswerEvidence.VISUAL_FACT` is capped by what the detector
  actually returned.
- `com.google.android.datatransport` arrives transitively through MediaPipe and
  registers a receiver and a JobService in the merged manifest. It cannot send
  anything -- there is no `INTERNET` permission -- but the guarantee rests on
  the missing permission, not on the library's absence. See §2.

**How to check any of this yourself**

```bash
./gradlew test          # 187 JVM tests, including the AI evaluation harness
```

The harness (`app/src/test/java/com/tasklens/eval/`) runs fourteen laptop-repair
scenarios plus two adversarial ones through the real parsers and grounding, with
no model file, and prints a PASS table. It evaluates *this app's* handling of a
model's output -- never how good the model is, which no JVM test can tell you.

## 7. The one thing that makes this project survivable

For roughly 10.5 hours of the event nobody can compile ("Red Light"). The only
compile windows are Sat 11:00–13:00, Sat 15:30–16:30 and Sun 01:00–06:30.

Therefore **no behaviour may be hardcoded**. Every number lives in
`core/Policy.kt` with a matching entry in `app/src/main/assets/policy.json`.
On first run the app copies the asset into `filesDir/policy.json` and from then
on reads **only** that file, watching the *directory* with a `FileObserver`
(editors and adb replace the inode, so a watch on the file itself would die).
Push a new file and the app retunes live, no restart. A malformed file is
logged and ignored; the last good policy stays in force.

If you add a knob, add it in **both** places, or the team cannot tune it during
Red Light.

## 8. House style

- Boring over clever. Shortest working diff. Delete before you add.
- Comments explain *why* a number or a branch exists, not what the line does.
  Match the density already in the file — it is deliberate.
- New non-trivial logic in `core/` gets a JVM test in
  `app/src/test/java/com/tasklens/core/`. UI does not.
- A deliberate shortcut with a known ceiling gets a `ponytail:` comment naming
  the ceiling and the upgrade path, the way `AdaptiveGate` and `StepCutter`
  already do.
- Never add a dependency for something a few lines can do. The debug APK is
  91 MB and every megabyte of it is a model library that actually runs.

## 9. Git rules (non-negotiable)

1. Work directly on `main`. Branch only for an experiment you might throw away.
2. `git pull` before you push. Every time.
3. Commit every 30–60 minutes with a plain message.
4. **Never `git push --force`.**
5. **Never commit a model file.** `.task`, `.onnx`, `.tflite`, `.gguf` and
   `**/models/` are gitignored. If `git status` shows one, stop.
6. Only push code that builds. Run `./gradlew test` first.
