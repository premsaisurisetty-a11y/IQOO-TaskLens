# Task Lens — architecture

Owner: Kshitij. The technical document the jury questions are answered from.
Start at [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) for constraints, ownership and commands;
this file is the detail underneath it.

Everything below describes code that exists today. Where something is a stub it
says so.

---

## 1. The product in one loop

**Show Mode** — the expert taps Start, does the job once, talks through it.
One continuous audio take is recorded. Silences in that take become step
boundaries. A photo is grabbed at each boundary. Stop, and ~a second later
there is a guide.

**Guide Mode** — the next person opens the guide and runs it with full hands.
Each step is a photo, a caption, and the slice of the original take where the
expert explained *that* step, in her own voice. The phone reads the room and
picks how to help; the user never chooses a mode.

`core/` being android-free is not tidiness. It is why "a room floored at -20 dB
by a ceiling fan" is a JVM test that runs in milliseconds instead of a trip to
a real kitchen with a real fan.

## 3. Recording data flow

```
mic
 └─ AudioRecorder.record(take.wav)          20 ms hops, 320 samples @ 16 kHz
     ├─ writes PCM16 to the WAV            (header rewritten on close, sizes
     └─ emits dbfs(buf) on `levels`         are only known then)
         │
         ▼
 TaskLensViewModel.onLevel(db)               50 calls a second
     ├─ gate.update(db)                     AdaptiveGate: floor + margin
     ├─ samples += Sample(tMs, db)          the authoritative log
     ├─ live boundary?  -> snap()           grab a photo for the next step
     ├─ _debug = _debug.copy(...)           feeds ShowScreen + DebugScreen
     └─ pushMode(db)                        ModeEngine.update(now, inputs)

 stopRecording()
     └─ buildGuide(id)
         ├─ StepCutter(policy).cut(samples, durationMs)   -> List<StepRange>
         ├─ ai.asr.transcribe(take.wav)                   -> List<Word>
         ├─ LinkWordConfirmer(policy words, spoken words)  -> vetoes cuts
         ├─ mapSnapsToSteps(snap times, ranges)            -> photo per step
         ├─ per range: Step(title, caption, startMs, endMs, photo, transcript,
         │              modeHint); caption comes from ai.captioner (canned)
         └─ GuideStore.save(guide)          guides/<id>/guide.json
```

Two separate cut passes exist on purpose: a cheap **live** one that only
decides *when to take a photo*, and the authoritative one that runs once at the
end over the whole sample log. They can disagree — see "Known defects".

## 4. The adaptive gate (the thing to be able to defend)

A fixed threshold cannot work. A ceiling fan floors a room around −20 dBFS; a
gate nailed at −38 dB reads that as continuous speech, finds no pause, and the
whole take comes back as one enormous step.

So the gate tracks the floor instead:

- `floorDb` starts at 0 and **falls fast** (`gateFallCoef` 0.25) toward any
  quieter sample — from 0 to a −20 dB fan in about half a second, which is why
  there is no priming special case.
- It **rises slowly** (`gateRiseCoef` 0.004), and is **frozen while speech is
  present**, so a long sentence cannot drag the floor up behind it. A room that
  genuinely gets louder is picked up in the next pause.
- `gateDb = (floorDb + speechMarginDb).coerceIn(gateMinDb, gateMaxDb)`.
- A silent mic reports −Infinity and a divide-by-zero reports NaN; both are
  sanitized to −120 before any arithmetic.

Tests: `AdaptiveGateTest` covers the fan-floored room, the clamp, the silent
mic, and "a long utterance does not drag the floor up".

## 5. The step cutter

1. Replay the sample log through a fresh `AdaptiveGate`.
2. Every silence run ≥ `pauseMs` that follows real speech yields a candidate
   cut **at the midpoint of the pause** — so the tail of one step and the run-up
   of the next both keep some air around them.
3. `CutConfirmer` gets a veto/second opinion. `LinkWordConfirmer` keeps a
   candidate only if `confirmMinLinkWords` linking words — "phir", "uske baad",
   "mag", "tyanantar", from `Policy` — were spoken within `confirmWindowMs`
   either side of it. Words near the cut are re-joined into one string first, so
   a two-token phrase like "uske baad" matches. With no recogniser, no word list
   or the knob at 0 it abstains and every cut passes: vetoing everything would
   hand back one enormous step, the exact failure the cutter prevents.
4. `mergeShort` drops the boundary after any segment shorter than
   `minUtteranceMs`, so it joins the next one. A short *tail* has no next, so
   the last boundary is dropped instead.
5. Hard cap at `maxSteps`; everything past the cap lands in the final step
   rather than being thrown away — the ranges must still tile the take.

Tests: merge-forward, the cap, exact tiling, a silence-only take, and the
confirmer pass-through.

## 6. The mode engine

Four modes, first match wins:

| Order | Mode | Condition | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | EASY | user setting | overrides everything, no guessing |
| 2 | HANDS | room is loud, or speech was unclear | gesture / big-target interaction |
| 3 | TALK | phone is flat on a counter, or user is far | voice + across-the-room type |
| 4 | TAP | held, quiet, close | ordinary touch |

Two Schmitt triggers (`inHand` on accel variance, `roomLoud` on dBFS) give
enter ≠ exit thresholds so a value sitting on the line cannot flip. On top of
that a **dwell**: a candidate must survive `dwellMs` before it is committed.
Without the dwell a borderline sample repaints the screen twice a second, and
that flicker is exactly the problem the product exists to solve.

Every commit carries a human-readable `reason` string
(`"HANDS <- room is loud (-24.3 dBFS)"`). The Debug screen shows it. It is also
the honest-limits answer for the jury: the phone says *why*, it does not guess.

`ModeEngineTest` asserts hysteresis, the dwell, table precedence, that every
switch carries a reason, and that a decision lands well inside 10 ms.

## 7. Policy hot-reload

```
assets/policy.json ──seed once──▶ filesDir/policy.json ──▶ PolicyStore ──▶ StateFlow<Policy>
                                        ▲                                        │
                        FileObserver on filesDir                                 ▼
                        (CLOSE_WRITE | MOVED_TO | MODIFY)          TaskLensViewModel rebuilds
                        filtered to "policy.json"                  AdaptiveGate + ModeEngine
```

- The asset is a **seed, once**. After that `filesDir` is the only source of
  truth — reading the asset again would make an override impossible.
- The observer watches the **directory**, not the file: editors and `adb`
  replace rather than modify, and a watch on an inode dies with the inode.
- `ignoreUnknownKeys = true` — a hand-edited file with a stray key is not a
  crash.
- Bad JSON: logged, `lastError` set, **previous good values kept**. The Debug
  screen prints the error.

## 8. Storage format

```
filesDir/guides/<id>/guide.json     Guide { id, title, lang, createdAt, take, steps[] }
filesDir/guides/<id>/take.wav       the single narration take
filesDir/guides/<id>/snap0.jpg …    named by SNAP order, not step order; which
                                    step owns which snap is decided by time in
                                    core.mapSnapsToSteps and stored in Step.photo
filesDir/policy.json                the live policy
```

Deliberately plain file IO. A guide you can drag from one phone to another with
a file manager is the whole sharing story — no server, no export format.

## 9. UI

Navigation is a sealed interface and a `when`. Navigation-Compose buys nothing
for five screens and costs an argument about routes at 2 am.

| Screen | State today | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `PlayerScreen` | photo + caption + "Hear it" (ExoPlayer clipping the take between `startMs`/`endMs`) + Back/Next buttons | 1 — needs four visual states and a mode reason bar; this is what the jury watches |
| `ShowScreen` | viewfinder, live level/gate readout, Start/Stop | 2 — needs a real mic meter and a step timeline building up live |
| `ReviewScreen` | read-only list of what the cutter produced | 3 — the pitch claims a person fixes the cuts in 20 s, so it needs join / split / re-record |
| `LibraryScreen` | list of guides + easy-mode switch | 4 — least important |
| `DebugScreen` | **done.** Every number that decides anything, plus the last mode reason and the live policy | — |

`TaskLensViewModel` is the only place the layers meet: it owns the recorder, the
motion flow, the gate, the engine, the guide store and the policy repo, and
exposes one `DebugState` so the debug screen repaints atomically.

## 10. Known defects and gaps

Ranked. Fix from the top. Everything here was checked against the code.

1. **The coach's memory use is still unmeasured.**
   `models/coach.task` is on the demo phone, but two bundles had to be thrown
   away before one would open. Both of the first attempts wrapped the legacy
   Kaggle Gemma 2B `.bin` under the `TF_LITE_PREFILL_DECODE` key; that file is a
   single `GEMMA_2B` subgraph with **no signature defs at all**, and
   tasks-genai 0.10.35 only opens a bundle whose model exposes `prefill_*` and
   `decode` signatures. That is the whole of `Decode runner not found for
   provided signature name base: decode`, reported identically on both
   backends -- and there was never a zip error, because the archive was always
   valid and repacking one could never have added a signature to the model
   inside it. The bundle in place now is the LiteRT-community
   `gemma3-1b-it-int4.task`, 555 MB, whose model carries five signatures:
   `decode` and `prefill_32/128/512/1024`, fifty-five inputs apiece. It loads:
   the first real run took the GPU in 15,894 ms and then answered a question in
   6,912 ms, read straight off the `coach on <backend> in N ms` and
   `answered in N ms` lines. Both are single-run figures on one phone and both
   want re-measuring on a cold device, but the load is inside
   `Policy.coachTimeoutMs` with room to spare. What is *not* measured is what it
   costs to hold: the model contends for RAM with Vosk and two MediaPipe graphs
   and nobody has watched the process while it does. It can no longer stall
   a guide build: the call is bounded by `Policy.coachTimeoutMs` and a coach
   that does not answer in time is treated exactly like a coach that is absent,
   which is a correct no-op with the steps left in the expert's own words.
2. **`userFar` is still hardcoded `false`.** It needs a face height in pixels;
   `TaskLensViewModel.feedFaceSize` and `Policy.userFarFaceHeightPx` are in place
   waiting for a MediaPipe face detector. The suggested brightness proxy is not
   a distance measurement, and §2's fourth constraint says this app does not
   guess at what it cannot honestly measure.
3. **The detector is generic COCO.** It knows "laptop", "keyboard", "person",
   and has no label for a screw, a RAM module, an SSD or a screwdriver. This is
   kept explicit everywhere it matters: detector output is a *count* when
   picking frames, tool names in a learner's context come from what the expert
   said rather than from the detector, and a `VISUAL_FACT` answer is capped by
   what was actually returned. Swapping in a fine-tuned `.tflite` is a file
   push; nothing needs rebuilding.
4. **No swipe gestures.** A swipe is motion over time, not a pose, so the canned
   classifier cannot emit one. Palm and fist already cover ±1 step.
5. `speechUnclear` is computed from the *previous* take's mean word confidence,
   because Vosk runs once over the finished WAV rather than live. It is the
   right signal on the wrong clock; a streaming recognizer would fix it.
6. `GuideStore.delete` has no UI.
7. `com.google.android.datatransport` is pulled in transitively by MediaPipe and
   registers a broadcast receiver and a JobService in the merged manifest. It is
   inert -- the app has no `INTERNET` permission, so any upload attempt would
   throw -- but the offline guarantee rests on the stripped permission rather
   than on the library not being in the APK.

**Fixed, listed here so nobody re-reports them:** the photo-indexing defect
(photos are paired to steps by time in `core/mapSnapsToSteps`, then quality-
filtered by `core/pickFrames`, both held by tests); the fakes (`Fakes.kt` is
deleted, every model is real); `RealSceneCheck` being unwired; `LinkWordConfirmer`
being a no-op; the guide language being hardcoded `"hi"`; `Guide.title` being
uneditable; `commit()` overwriting the coach's step titles; `Step.warning` never
being written; and guide building running on the main thread.

## 10b. What happens when something fails

Ranked by what it costs the person holding the phone. All five are held by
tests or by a guard at the one place every caller routes through.

**The take is the thing that cannot be regenerated.** An expert does the job
once. Everything else in a guide -- cuts, photographs, captions, rewrites --
can be rebuilt from `take.wav` later, and `take.wav` cannot be rebuilt from
anything. Every decision below follows from that.

| Failure | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| A background job throws | Uncaught out of `viewModelScope.launch`, straight to the thread's uncaught handler -- a crash dialog | Every job in the ViewModel goes through one private `launch` that installs a `CoroutineExceptionHandler`. It logs and dies alone. |
| The guide build fails anywhere | The coroutine dies, the Processing screen never moves, the take is unreachable | `salvageGuide` writes a one-step guide spanning the whole take and opens Review on it. The recording is always playable. |
| A recogniser or the coach hangs | Unbounded wait behind the Processing screen | `Policy.asrTimeoutMs` (90 s) and `Policy.coachTimeoutMs` (45 s), applied at the call site where the policy is in hand, so they bound *any* implementation rather than one model |
| A write is interrupted -- full disk, process killed | `writeText` truncates first, so a half-written `guide.json` will not parse and the guide vanishes from the library, take and photographs with it | Write beside it, then rename. Rename within a directory is atomic, so `guide.json` is at every instant entirely the old version or entirely the new one. `save` returns false instead of throwing. |
| The microphone will not open, or dies mid-take | The constructor threw out of the record job (a crash), or `read()` returned a negative error code forever and the loop span on it | `AudioRecorder.lastError` and a flat meter. Twenty consecutive bad reads ends the take rather than the battery. The WAV header rewrite is guarded and runs last, because a header claiming zero bytes is a lost take. |

`GuideStore` reports failures through an `onError` callback rather than
`Log.e`, the same shape as `PolicyStore`, so the class that holds the only copy
of an expert's work stays free of `android.*` and testable on the JVM.
`GuideStoreWriteTest` is what keeps the atomic write atomic.

## 11. Dependencies, and the model files that are not in git

`vosk-android` (ASR), `mediapipe-tasks-vision` (hand signs, object detection)
and `mediapipe-tasks-genai` (the coach) are the three ML dependencies, and all
three are used. `onnxruntime-android` was declared and never imported; removing
it took the debug APK from 122 MB to 91 MB.

The models themselves are gitignored and belong on the phone, not in the repo.
Every path is under `filesDir`, which is `/data/data/com.tasklens/files`:

```
models/vosk-en/                 unzipped Vosk model, conf/model.conf must exist
models/vosk-hi/                 one directory per language, never a shared one
models/vosk-mr/                 a Vosk model speaks exactly one language
models/gesture_recognizer.task  MediaPipe canned-gesture model
models/object_detector.tflite   fine-tuned tool detector, see 12
models/object_detector_coco.tflite  stock COCO, runs beside it, see 12
models/coach.task               Gemma 3 1B int4, step rewrite + Q&A
```

Install, from a machine with the files unzipped in `./models/`:

```bash
adb push models /data/local/tmp/models
adb shell run-as com.tasklens sh -c 'cp -r /data/local/tmp/models files/'
adb shell run-as com.tasklens ls files/models        # verify before the demo
```

`run-as` is required: `filesDir` is not world-writable, so a plain
`adb push` straight to it silently fails on a non-rooted phone.

Every model is optional at runtime and nothing is ever replaced by a fake:

| Missing | What happens |
|---|---|
| `vosk-<lang>/` | that language drops out of the picker; `NoopAsr` if all three are gone, so empty transcripts and the pause detector standing alone |
| `gesture_recognizer.task` | `Gesture.NONE` forever, the Player's buttons still work |
| `object_detector.tflite` | no tool boxes; COCO still names the room |
| `object_detector_coco.tflite` | no laptop, keyboard, mouse or person; the tools still box |
| both detectors | no boxes over the viewfinder, empty captions, transcript carries the step |
| `coach.task` | steps stay in the expert's own words, the ask sheet falls back to its token match over the transcripts |

Swapping a detector is a file push, not a build — drop a different
MediaPipe-compatible `.tflite` in as `object_detector.tflite` and retune
`detectMinScore` in `policy.json`. That is the whole upgrade path during Red
Light.

R8 is off in release on purpose: it breaks MediaPipe, which stack-walks to load
its native libraries. All three ML libraries ship their own
`libc++_shared.so`, hence the `pickFirsts` in `packaging`.

## 12. The fine-tuned detector

The object detector shipped as generic COCO -- eighty everyday classes, none of
them a tool. On a bench it drew `laptop 0.76` around the laptop, `person 0.77`
around the hand holding a screwdriver, and nothing at all around the
screwdriver, because there is no such class and no configuration adds one.

`tools/` holds the three scripts that replaced it. They need a free Roboflow
key in `~/.roboflow_key`, WSL or Linux, and about half an hour:

```bash
python3 tools/fetch_screw_datasets.py    # three public COCO exports
python3 tools/merge_screw_datasets.py    # -> one class list, ~875 train images
python3 tools/train_detector.py          # -> ~/sd_out/screwdriver.tflite
```

Model Maker rather than YOLO for one reason: it writes TFLite Model Metadata,
and MediaPipe's ObjectDetector refuses a model without it. The export drops
straight over `files/models/object_detector.tflite`, and `componentAliases` in
policy.json is what `ai/ComponentLocator` reads to decide what it may be asked
to point at.

Measured on the merged dataset, 30 epochs, one laptop RTX 3060:

| metric | value | what it means |
|---|---|---|
| AP@0.50 | 0.635 | does it box the right thing |
| AP large | 0.668 | a screwdriver held up to the camera |
| AP small | 0.157 | a screw head in a wide shot -- weak, get closer |
| load | 18 ms, NPU | on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 |

Classes: `screwdriver`, `philips_screw`, `pozidriv_screw`, `torx_screw`,
`hex_screw`, `square_screw`. `square_screw` had 23 training examples and should
be treated as untrained.

RAM, SSD, heatsink and battery are **still empty** in `componentAliases`. No
dataset covered them, so asking still answers "this detector has no label for
that" rather than borrowing a box from whatever happened to be nearby.

### Both models run, per frame

It did not replace COCO in the end -- it runs beside it. Held over a real bench
at `detectMinScore` 0.55 the fine-tuned model drew **nothing**; dropped to 0.02
it drew four boxes, one of them `philips` over a cartoon sticker. It is a small
model and a wide desk shot is exactly the case its AP small of 0.157 predicts it
will miss. Meanwhile a laptop repair guide with no `laptop` in it is not much of
a guide, and COCO was already sitting on the phone doing that job well.

So `ObjectDetectSource` takes a list of models and concatenates their boxes:

| model | answers for | floor |
|---|---|---|
| `object_detector.tflite` | `screwdriver` and the five screw heads | `detectMinScore` 0.30 |
| `object_detector_coco.tflite` | laptop, keyboard, mouse, person, tv | `detectMinScoreCoco` 0.50 |

Two floors because the models are not equally sure of themselves, and one
allowlist because they overlap: the fine-tuned `labels.txt` also carries
laptop, person, hand, keyboard and mouse, picked up along with the tool
datasets and backed by a handful of images each. COCO has tens of thousands per
class and wins those outright, so `TOOL_LABELS` in `TaskLensViewModel` holds the
fine-tuned model to the six classes it was actually trained for. Without it one
laptop gets two boxes and the weaker one sometimes wins.

Cost is a second inference per frame -- about 36 ms of NPU rather than 18, which
still fits inside the analyzer's 100 ms interval. Either file may be absent and
the other carries on; both absent is the empty-list case above.
